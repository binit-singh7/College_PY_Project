1. Grade calculator:

Grade Calculator is a Python project designed to calculate the grades of students based on their scores. The program takes input for assignments, quizzes, exams, or other assessments and outputs the final grade with an optional grading scale.

This tool helps students and educators quickly determine grades without manual calculations.


2. ATM Simulation:

This is a Python-based simulation of a basic ATM system. The program allows users to perform standard ATM operations, such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money, after verifying their PIN. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

3. Number guessing game:

The Number Guessing Game is a simple command-line Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With limited attempts, the game provides feedback to help the user refine their guesses. The program is designed to be interactive and beginner-friendly.

4. Basic Library Management System:


This system is designed to manage book borrowing in a library. Users can view available books, borrow books, and return books. The system ensures that books are borrowed and returned only by authorized users. Unauthorized users cannot access the library system.

5. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:

This is a simple Python-based implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. Players can play multiple rounds against the computer, and the program tracks the scores until the user decides to exit.

6.Calculator:

This is a Python-based simple calculator application that provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is interactive and uses a menu-driven approach to handle user input.

7.Unit Converter: 

This is a Python-based unit converter application that performs conversions between different units of measurement, including distance and temperature. The program provides an interactive menu for users to select and perform conversions easily.

8.Currency Converter: 

This Python application allows users to convert amounts between various currencies using predefined exchange rates. The program features an interactive console interface for selecting source and target currencies and entering the amount to convert.

9.To-Do List:

This Python application is a simple, interactive command-line tool for managing a to-do list. Users can add, view, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The program uses a menu-driven approach to allow easy navigation and interaction.

10.Hangman Game:

This Python program implements a simple command-line Hangman game. Players guess letters to figure out a randomly chosen programming-related word within a limited number of tries.
