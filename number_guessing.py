# 3. Number Guessing Game
# Objective: Build a guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
# Steps:
# 1. Use Pythonâ€™s random module to generate a number between 1 and 100.
# 2. Allow the user to guess the number.
# 3. Provide feedback ("Too high" or "Too low").
# 4. Limit the number of attempts to 5.
# 5. Display a success or failure message at the end.
